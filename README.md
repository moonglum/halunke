# Halunke

Halunke is a dynamic, object-oriented language that has a simple grammar
inspired by Smalltalk and Lisp. It is created to show that interesting
characteristics traditionally described as "functional" make sense in an
object-oriented language:

* Separation of identity and data (but not data and behavior)
* Immutability and persistent data structures
* Isolation of Side-Effects
* Pattern matching

It also has the following characteristics:

* There is no null/nil value in the language
